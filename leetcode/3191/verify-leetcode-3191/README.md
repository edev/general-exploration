# Verify LeetCode 3191

I wrote a solution to LeetCode problem 3191 in C++, and LeetCode accepted it. However, I am unconvinced that it is correct. The editorial has not convinced me that any of the solutions are provably correct, either. Therefore, this crate seeks to verify my algorithm through comparison to an exhaustive search. The program compiles, runs, and affirms that my algorithm produces equivalent results.
